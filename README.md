# alt_tab_helper
An Open Source App Switcher based on VistaSwitcher


This program, based on VistaSwitcher ( http://www.ntwind.com/software/vistaswitcher.html ), improves switching tasks on Windows.

Every time one pushes Alt + ` [the key above TAB and left to 1], it switches to another window of the same app.

One can use it to switch command prompts, terminal emulators, folders in windows explorer, browser windows, etc...

If one pushes Alt + Shift + `, than the reverse order will be used.

from which most of the code was based.

This program was developed and tested on Visual Studio 2015 with Windows 10. Please email me marcos AT unitron DOT com DOT br if it does not work on your platform.
